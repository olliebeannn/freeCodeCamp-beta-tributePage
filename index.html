          <p>George Saunders (born December 2, 1958) is an American writer, best known for his short stories, who has also written essays, novellas, children's books, and a novel.</p>

          <p>Saunders's fiction often focuses on the absurdity of consumerism, corporate culture and the role of mass media. While many reviewers mention the satirical tone in Saunders's writing, his work also raises moral and philosophical questions. The tragicomic element in his writing has earned Saunders comparisons to Kurt Vonnegut, whose work inspired Saunders. His work is often populated by a diverse array of characters with distinct, dialect-laden voices, and the use of the impersonal third person to allow the reader to enter their minds.</p>

          <p>He is the winner of numerous awards, including the National Magazine Award, Story Prize, and received a MacArthur Grant. He currently a professor of writing at Syracuse University.</p>
